Danganronpa is a series of videogames centered on the life of highly qualified students trapped inside Hope's Peak Academy. To escape the school and its deadly headmaster Monokuma, they must murder another classmates and not be accused of murdering them at the end of the class trial, where all the remaining student vote on who commited the murder. If the murderer is not undurcovered, they are free to escape and the rest of the class executed, if they fail to commit the perfect crime, they receive a 'punition' from Monokuma, aka a gruesome death.

Danganronpa is a visual novel, a very heavy scenario based video game with a lot of dialogue and therefore voice lines. In each of the 3 video games, the cast of 15 characters have distinct voice and thousands of voice lines.

I greatly enjoyed playing those games 2 years ago and had the idea of using a generative adverserial network in order to generate new voice lines for the character of the game. I decided to focus on 3 of the characters that talked the most, one from each game: Kyoko, Nagito and Kokichi.

This page is about my personal project DeepGanronpa. I did it because I wanted to challenge myself on mastering the science of GAN's.
