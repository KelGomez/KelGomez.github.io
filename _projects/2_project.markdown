In Paris, where I live, there is a beautiful place called " L'Atelier des Lumières " in english, The workshop of Light. I was very excited when they re-opened because they were holding an exposition of my favorite artist: Gustave Klimt. 

It is a kind of an experimental museum where artwork are projected on the wall on the giant warehouse using powerful projectors. They expploit the unique topology of the inside of the warehouse to create dream like scenaries. Here is a picture to give you an idea:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/atelier_lumiere.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>


It was an amazing experience. When I got out, I bought from the museum shop a giant 600 hundred page book called Gustave Klimt Tobias G. Natter. It is a complete collection fo all Klimt collections with high quality commentary. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/klimt_total.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

Since I already had experience in GAN and follow @genekogan on twitter, i decided to work on a  GAN Gustave Klimt artwork generator. In the same step as previous art GAN such as GANGogh, I started my project.

I tried to do a real research project, with a LaTeX final scientific paper, a short state of the art review of Deep Learning for Art generation from an artist and precise documentation and code commentary.

If you are interested in this project and want to discuss with me about it, please feel free to send me an email at sebastien.gomez2e2@gmail.com
