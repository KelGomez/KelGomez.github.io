In Paris, where I live, there is a beautiful place called "L'Atelier des Lumières" in english, The workshop of Light. I was very excited when they reopened because they were holding an exposition of my favorite artist: Gustave klimt. 

It is a kind of an experimental museum where artwork are projected on the wall on the giant warehouse using powerful projectors. Here is a picture to give you an idea:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/atelier_lumiere.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    L'Atelier des Lumières in Paris
</div>


It was an amazing experience. When I got out, I bought from the museum shop a giant 600 hundred page book called Gustave Klimt Tobias G. Natter. It is a complete collection fo all Klimt collections with high quality commentary.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/klimt_total.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>

Since I already had experience in GAN and follow @genekogan on twitter, i decided to work on a  GAN Gustave Klimt artwork generator. In the same step as previous art GAN such as GANGogh, I started my project.

I tried to do a real research project, with a LaTeX final scientific paper, a short state of the art review of Deep Learning for Art generation from an artist and precise documentation and code commentary.
