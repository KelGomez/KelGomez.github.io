Danganronpa is a series of videogames centered on the life of highly qualified students trapped inside Hope's Peak Academy. To escape the school and its deadly headmaster Monokuma, they must murder another classmates and not be accused of murdering them at the end of the class trial, where all the remaining student vote on who commited the murder. If the murderer is not undurcovered, they are free to escape and the rest of the class executed, if they fail to commit the perfect crime, they receive a 'punition' from Monokuma, aka a gruesome death.

Danganronpa is a visual novel, a very heavy scenario based video game with a lot of dialogue and therefore voice lines. In each of the 3 video games, the cast of 15 characters have distinct voice and thousands of voice lines.

I greatly enjoyed playing those games 2 two years and had the idea of using a generative adverserial network in order to generate new voice lines for the character of the game. I decided to focus on 3 of the characters that talked the most, one from each game: Kyoko, Nagito and Kokichi.

This page is about my personal DeepGanronpa. I did it because I wnated to challenged myself on mastering the science of GAN's.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
